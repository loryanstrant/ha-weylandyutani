### Design Philosophy

This theme recreates the look and feel of the Weyland-Yutani corporation's computer systems from the Alien franchise:

- **Nostalgic CRT Aesthetic**: Green monochrome terminal displays common in 1970s-80s sci-fi
- **Industrial Design**: Dark, utilitarian interface fitting for a spacecraft or research facility  
- **High Contrast**: Excellent readability with bright text on dark backgrounds
- **Subtle Effects**: Green-tinted shadows and glows for depth
- **Authentic Typography**: Fonts inspired by the [Typeset in the Future: Alien](https://typesetinthefuture.com/2014/12/01/alien/) analysis

### Typography

The theme includes authentic typography inspired by [Typeset in the Future: Alien](https://typesetinthefuture.com/2014/12/01/alien/), providing an authentic recreation of the film's iconic computer displays:

- **Display Headers**: **Thedus** (the actual custom display font from Alien) with 6 variants (Wide, Condensed, Stencil in regular and light weights)
- **Technical Interface**: **Orbitron** (similar to Eurostile, used extensively in the film's technical displays)
- **Body Text**: **Montserrat** (similar to Futura, used throughout the film)
- **Terminal/Code**: **IBM Plex Mono** (monospace font for technical readability with a retro feel)
- **Alternative Technical**: **Rajdhani** (additional sci-fi styling option for captions and small text)
- **Alternative Terminal**: **Share Tech Mono** (retro-terminal monospace option)

The Thedus font files are loaded locally from the theme, while other fonts load from Google Fonts CDN with system font fallbacks for optimal performance.

#### Font Details

The Thedus font provides the authentic Alien movie display typography with 6 variants:
- **Thedus Wide** (regular and light weights) - The main display font
- **Thedus Condensed** (regular and light weights) - Narrower variant for space-constrained layouts
- **Thedus Stencil** (wide and condensed) - Stylized variant with stencil cutouts

These fonts are loaded locally from the theme's `www/fonts/` directory, while other fonts (Orbitron, Montserrat, IBM Plex Mono, Rajdhani, Share Tech Mono) are loaded from Google Fonts CDN.

#### Using the Fonts

The fonts are **automatically loaded** when you apply the theme - no additional configuration needed! The theme uses the `card-mod-root` directive to inject the font CSS automatically.

**Font hierarchy:**
- **Large headers/titles**: Thedus (with Audiowide fallback) for that authentic Alien movie look
- **Interface elements**: Orbitron for technical displays and buttons
- **Body text**: Montserrat for readable content
- **Code/terminal**: IBM Plex Mono for monospace displays

#### Manual Font Installation (Optional)

If automatic loading doesn't work in your setup, you can manually add fonts as a Lovelace resource:

1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Dashboards ‚Üí Resources (top right menu)
2. Click "+ Add Resource"
3. URL: `/local/fonts/alien-fonts.css`
4. Resource type: Stylesheet
5. Restart Home Assistant

Or add to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
lovelace:
  resources:
    - url: /local/fonts/alien-fonts.css
      type: css
```

#### Verifying Fonts Are Working

To verify fonts loaded correctly:
1. Apply the Weyland-Yutani theme
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Go to Network tab and look for requests to `fonts.googleapis.com` and `/local/fonts/`
4. Headers and titles should display in Thedus and Orbitron fonts

#### Troubleshooting Fonts

**Fonts not loading?**
- Check browser console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console)
- Clear browser cache and hard reload (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Verify internet connectivity (Google Fonts require internet access)
- Try the manual installation method above

**Content Security Policy (CSP) errors?**
Add to your `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
http:
  use_x_forwarded_for: true
  trusted_proxies:
    - 127.0.0.1
```

#### Disabling Custom Fonts

To use system fonts instead:
1. Edit `themes/weylandyutani.yaml`
2. Remove or comment out the font-family definitions
3. Remove or comment out the `card-mod-root` section
4. Restart Home Assistant

#### Font Licensing

- Source: Original Alien movie display font

**Google Fonts:**
All Google Fonts used are open-source under the SIL Open Font License (OFL):
