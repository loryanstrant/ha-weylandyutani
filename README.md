## Theme Details

- **Accent**: Dark Green `#00B32E`
- **Warning**: Amber `#FFAA00`
- **Error**: Alert Red `#FF0000`

### Design Philosophy

This theme recreates the look and feel of the Weyland-Yutani corporation's computer systems from the Alien franchise:

- **Nostalgic CRT Aesthetic**: Green monochrome terminal displays common in 1970s-80s sci-fi
- **Industrial Design**: Dark, utilitarian interface fitting for a spacecraft or research facility  
- **High Contrast**: Excellent readability with bright text on dark backgrounds
- **Subtle Effects**: Green-tinted shadows and glows for depth
- **Authentic Typography**: Fonts inspired by the [Typeset in the Future: Alien](https://typesetinthefuture.com/2014/12/01/alien/) analysis

### Typography

The theme includes fonts inspired by those used in the Alien films:

- **Display Headers**: Audiowide (similar to Thedus, the custom font from Alien)
- **Technical Interface**: Orbitron (similar to Eurostile, used in technical displays)
- **Body Text**: Montserrat (similar to Futura, used throughout the film)
- **Terminal/Code**: IBM Plex Mono (monospace font for technical readability)
- **Alternative Technical**: Rajdhani (additional sci-fi styling option)

All fonts are loaded from Google Fonts and fall back to system fonts for optimal performance.

#### Font Installation

The fonts are automatically loaded when you apply the theme. For optimal performance:

1. The theme uses Google Fonts CDN (no local installation needed)
2. Fonts load asynchronously to prevent blocking
3. System fonts provide instant fallbacks

For detailed installation instructions and troubleshooting, see [www/fonts/INSTALLATION.md](www/fonts/INSTALLATION.md).

If you prefer to disable custom fonts, you can modify the theme YAML to remove the font-family definitions.
